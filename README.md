OS X Handmade Hero
==================

This is an ongoing OS X port of Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero.

This version uses native OS X libraries for the platform layer:
	- CoreAudio for sound
	- OpenGL for graphics
	- IOKit's HID for joystick input

The goal is to be able to drop in Casey's platform independent
source code and compile and run it unchanged.
